      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Imagine a snake made of sticky notes, each one representing a task delay or interruption.
        Every time a team member encounters a delay, they jot down the details on a sticky note
        and add it to the "end of the snake." Over time, this snake grows, revealing patterns of
        interruptions that might otherwise go unnoticed.
